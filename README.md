Simple Enconding And Decocding library with shamelessly stolen code. Base64 encoding and decoding. I might add more decoding and encoding methods here that is useful for general purposes.

For now, just drop in the base64.bf file in your project folder. Base64.Decode to decode, Base64.Encode to encode.
